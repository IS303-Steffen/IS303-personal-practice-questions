OPTIONAL AI GUIDANCE PROMPT:
----------------------------
I am a student in an introductory Python class. I am learning many coding
principles for the very first time. I am going to paste in the instructions to
a practice problem that my professor gave me to try before class. Please be my
kind tutor and walk me through how to solve the problem step by step.

Don't just give me the full solution all at once (unless I later ask for it).
Instead, help me work through it gradually, with clear explanations and small,
easy-to-understand examples. Please use everyday language and explain things
in a simple, friendly way.


INSTRUCTIONS:
-------------
You are working at a grocery store and need to process incoming shipments
from different shipping companies. Each shipment contains 3 items.

1. Use a while loop to keep asking for the name of the shipping company.
2. If the user enters "quit", stop the loop and end the program.
3. If a company name is entered, print a message like "Processing shipment
   from FedUp Co..."
4. Then, use a for loop to simulate receiving 3 items in that shipment.
5. Inside the for loop, ask the user to enter the item name.
6. Print a message like "Item received: Apples"
