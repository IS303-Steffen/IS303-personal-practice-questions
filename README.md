# Personal Practice Questions
This repository contains many Python practice questions organized by topic for BYU's IS 303 class. These are intended to be used as preparation before class, as well as extra practice for any concept you need some more time getting familiar with.

# Structure
Each folder contains several practice problems for that chapter. Each practice problem has a `"_practice_"` file and a corresponding `"_solution_"` file with one possible solution shown. Each file includes instructions, as well as a prompt to have AI guide you if you get stuck.

# Recommended Use:
- Step 1: Try and do the problem without any assistance.
- Step 2: If you have no idea where to start, or you get stuck, copy and paste the included "Optional AI Prompt" and the "Instructions" sections in each file to your preferred AI chatbot (chatGPT, Gemini, Copilot, etc.) and have it walk you through the problem.

If you are using these problems to practice before going to class and you don't know anythign about the new topic yet, feel free to start directly at step 2. If you've already learned something about the topic, try and do it yourself, and when you get to a part of the problem you can't figure out, you now know what you need to practice. Use AI, a TA, or the Professor and understand that portion, then try and redo the whole problem from the beginning without looking anything up.
